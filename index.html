		<p>This Classic Arcade Game project is focusing on Object Oriented Programming and HTML5 Canvas. In the original assignment, the basic engine was provided. The prewritten parts only contained a basic game loop and a few hints on how to build a basic prototypes for the game. <br>The game's visual assets (<a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html" target="blank">Danc's universal prototyping tiles</a>) were provided.</p>
		<p>The required functions of the game were collision detection with the enemy entities and a simple game reset, when the player collide with the bugs or reaches the top of the screen.</p>
		<p>The walls, the objectives, other objects, the indicator, start game and end game screens are all added functionality. </p>
		<p>The original assignment required console logging of the main events. Lookig at the concole, collisions, interactions with objects, the game's intialisation as well as the stopping of the game loop are all logged.</p>
